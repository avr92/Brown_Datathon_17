Python environment version used:\
2.7\
\
We have used the following libraries:\
\
- Numpy\
- Scikit sklearn\
- csv\
- random\
\
\
\
The program has three files:\
\
data_clean.py : It has all the functions coded in it that is responsible for cleaning the data\
\
RandomForest.py: It has all the functions  in it that builds a Random forest model and predicts the accuracy of the model. It also has a sampling functionalities, as it was very crucial for this project to performing sampling based on the feedback f the output.(Manual though, automated for ease by just changing certain parameter)\
\
main.py: It has main function that invokes all the other functionalities in order to effectively deploy, build and predict model accuracy. (It has a code fragment that reads the input file and a functionality that performs data processing to convert data types from nominal to numeric values.\
\
\
The program execution:\
\
Just execute the main.py file.}
